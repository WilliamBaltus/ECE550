Modules involved:
1. alu (obviously)
It determines the operation based on the opcode, selects the appropriate inputs, and computes the result. 

2. 4-bit CLA
Computes carry-out signals and block propagate and generate signals, stack a few of these to make 32-bit.

3. mux2to1
basic multiplexer that selects between two inputs based on a select signal. It is used to select between the normal and inverted data_operandB during subtraction.

SLL
Performs logical left shifts on a 32-bit input based on the shift amount

SRA
Performs arithmetic right shifts on a 32-bit input while preserving the sign bit
